Block Mode Attacks::ECB Decryption

This attack shows the weakness of ECB, a fault of the duplication of
identical blocks. In particular, an attacker with access to an 
encryption function can detect and decrypt any appended text.
This attack works with a worst case of 257n encryption requests,
though certainly the search space could be reorganized to improve
the speed of the attack (e.g., placing frequent English letters
first), but it is important to note that the attack is linear with
respect to length.

Thinking about the duplication of blocks, consider a known plaintext,
P, prepended to the unknown text U. Since blowfish has a block length
of 8 bytes (the primitive), consider a plaintext of length 7. When
encrypted under ECB, the first byte of U will instead fill its slot.
When passed to the remote encryption function, the first block will
consist of 7 known characters and one unknown character. But since the
attacker controls the first block, he can brute force all 256 possible
combinations for the remaining character. This can then be repeated
with a known plaintext of 6 characters, and then the second unknown
character of the appended text can be decrypted.


Repeating for all blocks reveals the original ciphertext.
