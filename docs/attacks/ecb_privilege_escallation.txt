Block Mode Attacks::ECB Privilege Escalation

This attack uses the weakness of ECB mode, combined with a cut-and-paste
attack to change an encrypted cookie to escalate role=user to role=admin.
In particular, the user can enter any email (s)he desires, except for
those containing special characters & and = (so simply setting the
email to role=admin would not work). 

First, we detect the absolute length of the original plaintext, by
detecting when the size increases by a block length. Then, we can
detect how long the prefix plaintext is by detecting a pair of
duplicate blocks. Finally, we build a block of value
"admin\x03\x03\x03" (a correctly padded block), and align
the user to a fresh block ("user\x04\x04\x04\x04"), before pasting
the encrypted form of admin over the top, creating role=admin.

Passing this to the is_admin function results in true.
