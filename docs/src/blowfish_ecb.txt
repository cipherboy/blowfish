Blowfish - Electronic Codebook (ECB) Block Cipher

Documentation:

blowfish_ecb(char* key_data, int key_length);
    Initialize the blowfish sub-keys and s-boxes based off the given key; same
    as blowfish(); constructor.

char* block_encrypt(char* data, int data_length);
    Input length required to be a multiple of 8 (block size), otherwise
    NULL is returned as output. Returned char* pointer must freed.

    Encryption:
        for each 8-byte block to length of input:
            encrypt(block)
            append block to result

        return result

char* block_decrypt(char* data, int data_length);
    Input length required to be a multiple of 8 (block size), otherwise
    NULL is returned as output. Returned char* pointer must freed.

    Decryption:
        for each 8-byte block to length of input:
            decrypt(block)
            append block to result

        return result
