Blowfish - Electronic Codebook (ECB) Block Cipher

Documentation:

blowfish_ecb(std::string key_data);
blowfish_ecb(const char* key_data, int key_length);
    Initialize the blowfish sub-keys and s-boxes based off the given key; same
    as blowfish(); constructor.


std::string block_encrypt(std::string data);
char* block_encrypt(const char* data, int data_length);
    Input length required to be a multiple of 8 (block size), otherwise
    NULL is returned as output. Returned char* pointer must freed.

    Note: std::string result does not need to be freed. May return an empty
    string if data is not of a length that is a multiple of 8.

    Encryption:
        for each 8-byte block to length of input:
            encrypt(block)
            append block to result

        return result


std::string block_decrypt(std::string data);
char* block_decrypt(const char* data, int data_length);
    Input length required to be a multiple of 8 (block size), otherwise
    NULL is returned as output. Returned char* pointer must freed.

    Note: std::string result does not need to be freed. May return an empty
    string if data is not of a length that is a multiple of 8.

    Decryption:
        for each 8-byte block to length of input:
            decrypt(block)
            append block to result

        return result
