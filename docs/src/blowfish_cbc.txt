Blowfish - Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Block Cipher

Documentation:

blowfish_cbc(std::strinG key_data);
blowfish_cbc(const char* key_data, int key_length);
    Initialize the blowfish sub-keys and s-boxes based off the given key; same
    as blowfish(); constructor.


char* block_encrypt(const char* data, char* iv, int data_length);
    Input length required to be a multiple of 8 (block size), otherwise
    NULL is returned as output. Returned char* pointer must freed.

    Encryption:
        set last_block to IV

        for each 8-byte block to length of input:
            current = block xor last_block
            blowfish->encrypt(current)
            last_block = current
            append current to result

        return result


char* block_decrypt(const char* data, char* iv, int data_length);
    Input length required to be a multiple of 8 (block size), otherwise
    NULL is returned as output. Returned char* pointer must freed.

    Decryption:
        set last_block to IV

        for each 8-byte block to length of input:
            saved_block = block
            blowfish->decrypt(block)
            block = block xor last_block
            last_block = saved_block
            append block to result

        return result
